in this video i want to answer a question for me and for you, linux or windows for our work, i work as an engineer who is using standard software like Autodesk, Revit, and other and those company adopt there is own bussness model, while those companies wont support the linux, so i am stuck with windows, 

what is the problem with windows, the windows make you a user, just user every thing other wise is a black box, and for whom that needs more they litrety offfer nothing to them leaving them

the second it is a company software, which in another part of the world

open source software is very good if they are small the golden rule is do on thing and do it perfect, so if you intend to use any open source it must be located on this type, however there is many other software which are complex like some programing language like python, or even os like linux or eather software like blender but they are another story,
