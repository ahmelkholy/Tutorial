
Hello my dear viewers, welcome to another episode of El-Daheeh. Imagine with me for a moment that you are a seagull flying over the Mediterranean Sea towards the east, until you reach a point on the coast between Tel Aviv and Haifa. There you will find a charming and beautiful place known today as Dor, an ideal resort not less wonderful than the beaches of Greece, Cyprus, and Sicily. It boasts soft sand, a pleasant atmosphere, and coral reefs. There is greenery around and beyond the beach, a museum, and some archaeological sites that date back to the Bronze Age. Many houses there resemble those from Florida, giving a distinctive charm to the area. Of course, there are many resorts around with various services and facilities.

Since you're still a seagull who knows nothing about the place, you'll see a modern resort from the sky called Nahsholim. A few meters away from it, there's a small building with a different style that doesn't really fit in with the surrounding area. This house, built in an old Arab style, stands out amidst the many Western and modern-styled buildings. In 1991, a resident decided to build a diving center next to this house. Workers and equipment arrived, and the drilling began. However, they suddenly stopped when they found the remains of human bones buried at a shallow depth. They closed everything up, left, and never returned.

This was witnessed by a fisherman named Fouad Hasadiyeh, who lives in the Arab village of Al-Faradis. When he asked the project owner why they left, he was told, "We found bones and remains from Napoleon's age." But Fouad claimed, “No, these are the remains of Palestinians who were killed in 1948 and buried there." His father and grandfather had told him about the massacre committed by Israeli soldiers in this place, and that the dead were buried in mass graves. One of these graves is under the parking lot of that Nahsholim Resort. All of this happened before the resort was built and before the place was renamed Dor. It occurred when it was a Palestinian fishing village called Tantura.

Tantura was a small Palestinian village located south of Haifa. Until 1948, its population was about 1,500 Palestinians who depended on fishing and farming. It was a quiet, small, and beautiful village. After the Nakba and for 50 years until approximately 2000, nothing was said about Tantura in Israel other than it being a village that witnessed a "battle" during the war of "Independence" between the Israelis and "Arabs." The Israelis won, and the Arabs "immigrated" from the village to the nearby village of Al-Faradis. The settlers then established Kibbutz Nahsholim there.

This remained the situation until 1998 when an Israeli student at the University of Haifa, named Teddy Katz, published his master's thesis. While preparing his research, he met a number of old soldiers from a military brigade of the Israeli army called the Alexandroni Brigade. These soldiers were responsible for entering Tantura on May 22, 1948. With their testimonies, Katz discovered that the so-called battle was not a real battle. It wasn't a confrontation between two armies or two armed parties. Despite the villagers' attempts to resist, they were poorly armed and had little experience in fighting, so the battle ended before it even started. The families' surrender after their defeat was not an escape from death but the beginning of a massacre.

On the night of May 22nd and the morning of the 23rd, Israeli soldiers invaded the village of Tantura. They separated the men from the women. Women were stripped of their money, gold, and anything of value. They were expelled from the village, wandering into the unknown with no place to go. As for the village's men, the soldiers gathered them on the beach near the Arab House. This included not only old men but also any boy who looked over 13 years old. By the Arab house, the execution began.

The testimonies that Teddy Katz heard from the soldiers were terrifying and were later shown combined in a movie called "Tantura" by an Israeli director named Alon Schwarz. One soldier recounted that they put people into a barrel and shot them inside it, remembering the blood in the barrels. Another testimony came from a soldier who later held a significant position in the Defense Ministry, describing how he killed one Arab after another with his pistol. A third soldier named Amitzur Cohen, laughingly admitted, “I was a murderer. I didn't take prisoners.” He couldn't recall how many he killed, stating, “I didn't count. I had a machine gun with 250 bullets. I can't say how many.”

What I am telling you is not the testimonies of the victims but those of the killers. These accounts are from individuals who would likely try to downplay the severity of their actions, making the horror of the events even more striking. The victims' testimonies are far more horrific, and you can read them in detail in various sources. Most of the victims were displaced as refugees in camps, some in Syria, and some still live today in the village of Al-Faradis. They live just a few kilometers away from where their families are buried, without knowing the exact burial sites, which are mere guesses.

In May 2023, a research agency called "Forensic Architecture" published the results of an investigation to answer the question of where these people were buried. They brought aerial photographs of the Tantura village taken between 1946 and 1949—pictures before and after the massacre. By analyzing these images and comparing them with current maps and recent satellite images, along with 3D modeling of the changes that occurred, and collecting testimonies from massacre survivors, they produced a report that accurately identifies the locations of mass graves. The two largest of these are located next to the cemeteries of the old village and under the parking lot serving a beach and resort.

If you search for these places on Google now, the first thing you will encounter is hotel reservations and places for activities, despite the fact that all of this is built literally on top of execution fields and mass graves. Tantura stands as a metaphor for all of Israel—a very thin and fragile layer of "Western urbanization," beneath which lies evidence of killing, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. My dear viewers, everything I have shared so far comes from Israeli sources, not Western but Israeli. The Arab sources contain much uglier details, but I have a reason for choosing these sources.

I want to showcase some examples of the few Israeli voices that have tried to dig into the roots of the Nakba and tell you what happened to them at the hands of "The Only Democracy in the Middle East!" These individuals were silenced. Take Teddy Katz, for instance, who conducted interviews with soldiers. He faced a defamation case raised against him by war criminals! His master's thesis was withdrawn from the university library, he was forced to retract everything he said, and his academic career was completely destroyed.

Eyal Weizman, who founded Forensic Architecture (whose work you saw earlier), faced lighter punishment. His books, especially "Hollow Land," were banned in Israel. This book is considered a book of conviction, as it explains the Israeli occupation's method of building settlements in a way that strangles and expels Palestinians. These aren't isolated cases; there are many examples of those who try to talk about the Nakba in Israel and are subsequently silenced. So much so that in 2011, the Knesset approved a law called the “Nakba Law,” granting the Ministry of Finance the right to suspend government funding and support from any institution that discusses the Nakba.

This means that if a professor at a university or a research institution gives a lecture about the Nakba, the government has the right to suspend its support and funding for that university. Because of this law, many books weren't published, articles weren't issued, films weren't shot, and so on. This is all to ensure that no one challenges the fabricated narrative that Israel is trying so hard to propagate about itself, especially if that person is Jewish and not Zionist. This is strange to them. To the point that these anti-Zionist Jews are labeled "Self-hating Jews," a derogatory term. One of the most well-known "Self-hating Jews" is Ilan Pappé, who was effectively expelled from the University of Haifa and is the author of "10 Myths About Israel." These myths form the fictional legend Israel is feeding to the world, especially the West.

The narrative that Israel tells about itself, the national narrative dictated to children in schools, can be seen in two ways: either as a bunch of lies and stop there, or as a bunch of lies that we need to understand to know why the world believes them so readily. This myth-like narrative begins with the Jewish kingdoms on the land of Palestine, which fell apart, and the temple of Solomon was destroyed along with them. Since 70 A.D., Jews were dispersed throughout the world and, for 2000 years, subjected to discrimination and oppression that peaked during the Holocaust. As a survival attempt, the remaining Jews decided to escape and return to the land of their ancestors. That's the first part of the narrative, where Israel presents itself in a weak moment of birth, earning sympathy and making it easier for people to buy their story later on.

The rest of the story can be seen in the sixth-grade geography book in Israeli schools, describing the return of the "brave" settler Jews who bought the land and built it using all modern technology. To paint a perfect picture, the book says the settlers arrived and saw a land of ruins and swamps. They began digging wells for fresh water, used fertilizers to farm the land, developed technologies, and cleared the swamps, eliminating malaria that was killing them. They also established cities like Tel Aviv, the first port in the region, despite the shallow sea making it hard to build a port. This part is meant to entice admiration and portray the settlers as weak people who succeeded against the odds, reminiscent of white settlers in North America who built the United States.

Until this part of the story, they achieved two things: sympathy and admiration. Any story needs a conflict and a villain. The first villain in the Israeli story is surprisingly the British Mandate, which hindered Jewish migration and tried to abort their dream of building a state. This villain is depicted as trying to stop Jews from escaping death in Europe and coming to build their new home, making the listener hate the British Mandate and root for the heroes—Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin, Ariel Sharon, and Shimon Peres—who joined military organizations like Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi.

These names are smartly chosen. For instance, Lehi meant "fighters for the freedom of Israel," making it easy to sympathize with them and believe in Jewish bravery and sacrifice. These heroes forced Britain out of the land, leading to independence from the mandate and freedom from historical diaspora. The narrative continues with the UN's Resolution 181 in November 1947, partitioning Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state. On May 14, 1948, Israel became a country with David Ben-Gurion as its prime minister. Just one day after, the narrative introduces a second villain: the seven Arab armies that supposedly united to exterminate the Jews.

This story is akin to an American film plot, where after defeating the first villain, a second appears. In this narrative, Israel is depicted as David, the young weak man who defeats the mighty Goliath, represented by the Arab armies. This story aims to gain sympathy for Israel and paint the Arabs as the aggressors. The narrative even claims that Palestinian Arabs left their lands to give the seven armies a chance to kill the Jews and that Israel tried its best to convince Palestinians to return, but they refused and preferred to live as refugees. This story tries to convince the world that Israel has always been striving for peace, despite being surrounded by hostile neighbors.

This entirely fake story, filled with lies and half-truths, portrays Israel as the underdog, making it easy to sympathize with. For many decades, Israel has invested in spreading this narrative in the West, ensuring the real story is buried beneath. I'm here today to tell you about the real story—the Nakba.

## **FIRST MYTH: 'ONE PEOPLE'**

My friend, the first myth is that there's something called "The Jews," a single entity existing since the beginning of history, united as one people, one race, with the same hopes, and oppressed for 2000 years—not as individuals, but as a single entity.

أسطورة أضطهاد 2000 سنة

However, if we look at Jewish communities in Europe and compare them to Jewish communities in Arab countries by the end of the 19th century, it quickly becomes apparent that this isn't true. For example, there were 150,000 Jews in Morocco and 80,000 in Egypt at the beginning of the 20th century. In Baghdad, Iraq, there were 50,000 Jews, making up 25% of Baghdad's population. These Jewish communities were part of the Arab countries they lived in. They were Jewish Arabs whose lives and properties were safe, and they had their own schools and places of worship. While they faced issues like any minority, they were an integral part of the societal fabric. All these countries were part of the Ottoman Empire, which was tolerant of the Jews living there.

On the other hand, in Europe, Jews faced a different reality, one shaped by the changes Europe was undergoing at the time. If we look at Europe's map at the beginning of the 19th century, we see grand empires transitioning into nation-states. These empires spanned vast territories, encompassing diverse peoples, races, and religions. Kings succeeded each other, and minorities were often second-class citizens, sometimes under good conditions and sometimes not. Jewish communities in European empires were a minority, living in self-enclosed areas known as "ghettos." Their interaction with the outside world was limited, and they saw themselves as different.

The concept of nation-states that replaced empires changed this situation. Germany unified from several scattered small kingdoms into a single German state, and the same occurred in Italy and Poland. Dr. Fawzy El-Bedwy, a professor of Jewish Studies at Université de la Manouba, explains that nation-states offered the promise of a new reality—no more minorities or majorities, just citizens. "We're all German, Italian, or Polish," he says. Despite differences in religion or race, the idea was that everyone would be integrated as citizens within one nation.

The Jewish reaction to this ideology varied. Some Jewish communities rejected the idea of nation-states, while others embraced it, hoping for a future where they could live as equal citizens, integrated into the fabric of their respective nations. This promise of equality and integration offered by nation-states was a significant departure from their previous experiences under empires, and it fundamentally changed the dynamics of Jewish life in Europe.

They saw that the only way they could remain Jews and not integrate and forget their history was to isolate themselves and reject this new reality, distinguishing themselves from the new identities being formed. This fear was fueled by the violence that many European Jewish communities faced, especially in Russia and Poland, where the term "pogrom" originated. A Russian word, "pogrom" means the killing of Jews, destroying their properties, and burning their houses.

On the other hand, some European Jewish communities believed that this violence was temporary and would disappear over time. They saw integration as the solution. They saw an opportunity to learn and benefit from the rapidly changing European knowledge and to assimilate into society by taking on modern professions such as doctors, poets, and bank clerks. They believed that their culture would not vanish because religion and language would preserve it. In both cases, whether those in favor of or opposed to this new reality, Jews saw themselves as European citizens in European countries.

All of this denies the existence of a separate entity called "Jews." In the end, Jews are individuals in communities whose conditions change from best to worst or vice versa, depending on the historical period and geographical location they lived in. The Zionist ideology, however, tries to do the opposite: to depict Jews as a unique condition in history, with aggression against them being fixed and fateful. This perspective is so extreme that a Zionist thinker named Leon Pinker described anti-Semitism as a 2000-year-old genetic disease and infection.

## **SECOND MYTH: 'ZIONISM IS JUDAISM'**
أسطورة الصهيونية هي اليهودية

The anti-Zionist Israeli historian Ilan Pappe said that the worst thing Zionism did was manipulating Judaism to use religion as a justification for implementing an originally colonial ideology. " please, break it down, I don't get it." I know you, you like stories. You want a story with a conflict and a villain, right? I told you a while ago, some Jews accepted integration, and others didn't. Among those who accepted integration was an Austrian journalist named Theodor Herzl. He grew up in a very rich Jewish family, was well-educated with a German education, and only knew the word "Shalom" in Hebrew. His relationship with religion was almost non-existent. Some people say he was on the verge of atheism. "Wait, Herzl, the father of Zionism and Israel, had a non-existent relationship with religion and wanted to integrate into Europe?" That's the dramatic plot; it's a coming-of-age genre.

In 1894, Herzl went to Paris to cover an important case involving a Jewish French officer named Alfred Dreyfus. This man was accused of leaking classified information to the Germans. This case shook France, dividing the people. Some advocated for his innocence, while others accused him of treason. Up to this point, it was a typical case with court proceedings and slogans. However, what wasn't normal were the demonstrations against Dreyfus, where people were chanting, "Death to the Jews." This happened in Paris, the beating heart of modernism. It's true that some sources say Herzl exaggerated and that the chant was "Death to the Traitor," but either way, Herzl saw this as a turning point. It made him lose faith in integrating into societies. "So he was now prone to isolation?" Not exactly. He let go of the integration vs. isolation dilemma and turned to a third option that was not known at the time nor had an audience in European Jewish communities: an idea called Zionism. 

"So Jews weren't Zionists to begin with?" Nope. Zionism is an ideology that appeared in the 16th century, primarily among Christians, especially Protestants, and even more specifically in Britain. The idea was simply that Jews should go to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple in preparation for the Second Coming of Jesus. This idea persisted until the 19th century as a normal concept that existed but was largely ignored by Jews. They would hear it and think, "You don't want us to be citizens, and you want us to leave so you can be citizens alone? We get it." However, Jewish Zionism in the 19th century, especially Herzl's Zionism, was different. It wasn't as simple as taking Jews back to Jerusalem.

The Egyptian writer Al-Sayed Yassin, in his book "Dissecting the Israeli Mind," provides a clearer and more detailed picture of Jewish Zionism. Jewish Zionism is a racist ideology. It posits that all humans everywhere and at all times harbor deep hatred for Jews. Even if you asked a four-year-old who just learned how to talk if he loves Jews, he might say yes, but Jewish Zionism claims he doesn't mean it. Zionism views the non-Jewish world as inherently hostile, believing that this deep-seated hatred is simply because they are not Jewish. The only solution for Jews to be safe, according to this ideology, is to create a state solely for Jews, without others. This state would either be exclusively Jewish or have a Jewish majority that rules. Herzl documented this ideology in his book "The Jewish State."

"Abo Hmeed, now who exactly are the Jews?" I don't have an answer to this question, but I can tell you the Zionist definition of it. The Zionist definition is that Jews are one pure race, from the beginning of time until the end. They are not just a religion; Judaism isn't a proselyte religion that seeks to convert others or marry outside the faith. Zionism sees Jews as a pure people or race, which is inherently a racist ideology. Moreover, according to the researcher Badiaa Amin, one of the Zionist principles is that Jews are only oppressed by others, but a Jew could never oppress another Jew. Remember the concept of the self-hating Jew? Zionism gets shaky when a Jew criticizes it. In short, Zionism is based on the belief that the whole world hates Jews and that those who don't are prone to.

Herzl saw that oppression, hatred, and anti-Semitism were the forces that would lead Jews to the solution. In his words, "We are one people; our enemies have made us one." I find this idea a little scary, my friend—that the unification of some people is based on the hatred of others towards them, so you're defined by the people who hate you. Indeed, without anti-Semitism, Zionism wouldn't have existed. Can you imagine an ideology that's based on people rejecting it, and once everyone accepts it, it falls apart? Herzl believed that anti-Semitism would be the force that enabled the Jews to build their state.

In summary, Zionism was an idea that reacted to discrimination against Jews with discrimination against everything that wasn't Jewish. The solution was for Jews to live in a state by themselves. Herzl pondered where this state should be. Suggestions included Argentina, Uganda, Madagascar, and Russia because, as I mentioned, it had nothing to do with religion. The main concern was to establish a state for protection from the deep-seated hatred of Jews among non-Jews. Here's a surprise: most Jewish communities to whom Herzl proposed the Zionist and state solution didn't pay much attention. "You go, and we'll come later." These were the oppressed themselves, questioning why they should emigrate from places they had been living in and instead demanding their rights. "Even if we emigrate, we'll emigrate to the New World, America," which had already become the first destination for European Jews, transforming New York in the late 19th century into the most important Jewish city in the world.

The first Jewish congress was set to be held in Munich, but interestingly, the German Jews refused, so much so that many rabbis saw Zionism as a challenge against the divine fate of diaspora for the Jews. That's when Herzl thought of the idea we spoke about earlier: to convince all these people, he needed a really compelling story, even if it wasn't real. He needed a legend for people to believe in. In her book "A Short History of Myth," Karen Armstrong says that a myth is true because it's effective, not because it's a fact. Herzl understood that Europeans were afraid of traveling to an unknown place. "What would we do in Uganda? Too hot. What would we do in Russia? Too cold. Why would we be oppressed and cold?" But what if the destination was known, guaranteed, and holy? A happy ending to a sad story. This was the only way he managed to convince them. "We won't immigrate to a new place; we'll go back home."

At that time, in the first Zionist congress in Basel in 1897, the Zionist movement announced its destination: Palestine. According to the Argentinian sociologist Pedro Bridger, Herzl turned the biblical idea of diaspora, this epic story, into a modern ownership document to claim Palestine, framing immigration as not just a political solution but a religious duty. This is when the confusion between Zionism and Judaism began, creating the fallacy that Judaism equals Zionism and that anti-Zionism is the same as anti-Judaism.

## **THIRD MYTH: 'A LAND WITHOUT PEOPLE'**

The myth of "a land without people" is one of the most famous Zionist ideas. Despite this, Palestine during the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a fully integrated society with a Muslim majority, Christians, and a Jewish minority. This society, despite its religious diversity, was culturally homogenous. Yaffa, the largest city on the east coast, had more than 60,000 Palestinians. It had cinemas, theaters, and a port that was hundreds of years older than Tel Aviv's new port. The British delegate who came to Palestine between 1871 and 1877 wrote a 12-part encyclopedia about Palestine, documenting the names of 13,000 places! This leaves us with two possible interpretations of the phrase "Land without People."

The first interpretation, as proposed by Pedro Brieger, is that the leaders of the Zionist movement, in their quest for the promised land—the holy land where their dreams would come true—knew little about it. To them, the world was just Europe, and the only information they had about Palestine came from adventurers and travelers. If you're a traveler, you won't return to Europe and describe the cinemas and theaters in Yaffa; it's not exotic enough. Instead, you paint a picture of the primitive East with tents, camels, and stories from "A Thousand and One Nights," portraying an empty land awaiting the return of the Jews. This is the first interpretation of "Land without People."

The second interpretation is proposed by the Palestinian historian Salman Abu-Sitta, who said that "a land without people" was the Zionist intention—to make the land devoid of its native population. Let me explain. Until the end of the 19th century, the percentage of Jewish immigrants did not exceed 3%, under Ottoman rule. Herzl attempted to persuade the Ottoman Sultan to designate land for the Jews, but the Sultan refused, although he allowed continued immigration. This was because the Ottomans and Arabs did not have a problem with Jews living peacefully among them. However, they opposed Zionists. 

Immigration continued, and in 1907, the Zionist Chaim Weizmann established a land development company in Yaffa. Weizmann, an extremely important figure in Zionist history, was a Jew whose relationship with religion was almost non-existent. This company's goal was to purchase land from Palestinians in an organized manner. However, according to American professor Walter Lehn, in an agrarian society, landlords refused to give up their land for money because it was the basis of their livelihoods. The deals often conditioned the expulsion of Arab farmers, aiming to create "a land without people" to make room for Jewish settlers.

Zionists only succeeded in purchasing land from absentee landlords, such as one Lebanese family living in Europe, which sold 200,000 km² in Marj Ibn Amer to Jewish entities. Up to this point, it might seem innocent—Jews immigrating from Europe to farm new lands. But the structure of the farms they built didn't support this idea. The Zionists refused to hire Palestinian workers. They were there to replace the local population, not integrate with them, aiming to create "a land without people." Consequently, all workers were Jewish. In Marj Ibn Amer, 60,000 Palestinians were displaced and replaced by immigrant Jews.

The second measure was the formation of Land Guards, Jewish security troops called Hashomer, to protect these lands, as anything outside was perceived as a threat. This guard strengthened the relationship between Jews and the "new land." The third measure was economic boycott: "We'll economically boycott Palestinians. We're here to make Jewish products and work with Jews." This strategy, while perhaps not clear at the time, became evident as the 20th century progressed. It raised concerns among some Palestinians, and newspapers like Al-Karmel, issued in 1909, publicly warned against the Jewish settlement movement.

Despite these warnings, immigration continued. Before World War I, the number of Jews in Palestine increased from 24,000 to 50,000. Although this number doubled, it still wasn't sufficient for the Zionist settler movement, which felt it would take them a hundred years to achieve their goals. "What would we do with 50k? We need to pace things up." Like anyone wanting to build a project, they needed an investor. And who was the perfect candidate? Britain.

## **FOURTH MYTH: 'BRITAIN THE ENEMY'**

أسطورة الإستقلال عن بريطانيا

In the conventional Israeli narrative, Britain is portrayed as an enemy that tried to hinder the establishment of the Israeli state. However, if we look at history, we see it's quite the opposite. Without Britain, the Zionist project wouldn't have succeeded. Before World War I in 1914, years after the immigration of European Jews to Palestine, their number didn't exceed 50,000, while the Palestinian population was 500,000. According to Zionist belief, Jews would be oppressed as a minority. "We'd escape from being a minority in Europe to be a minority in a new land?" This is when Chaim Weizmann leaned into the UK, saying, "Don't you want to help us leave you and go to Palestine? We're all Europeans; we'll be your arms and legs there for your interests in the region." Britain agreed and supported Zionism, easing Jewish immigration into Palestine.

One might ask, "Why would Britain so willingly offer help?" If you focused on the episodes, you wouldn't have asked. Britain fought Germany in World War I, and Germany's ally was the Ottoman Empire, which was collapsing. Britain, as a colonial force, had its eyes on many Ottoman states, including Palestine. Britain feared that Germany might enter Palestine during the war, threatening the Suez Canal, which was crucial for Britain's route to its colonies in India. "You want to be as close to Palestine and Suez Canal to close it up and deny my access to my colonies in India?" Of course not. Moreover, Palestine's geographical location, close to the Mediterranean and Red seas and between important Arab capitals like Cairo and Damascus, made it strategically vital. Britain wanted to lay its hands on Palestine and ensure loyalty by allowing European settlers there.

In 1915, British Zionist minister Herbert Samuel submitted a secret document to the Parliament titled "The Future of Palestine," advocating for a Jewish state in Palestine under a full British mandate. This mandate would ease immigration and increase the Jewish population to 4 million. In 1917, this suggestion turned into the Balfour Declaration, a letter from British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour, a Zionist and an anti-Semitic Christian, promising a national home for Jews. But there's a trick. What does a "national state" for Jews mean? Would Europe's Jews live in Palestine under the British mandate, or would it be an actual Jewish state ruled by Jews? The exact meaning wasn't clear to the English themselves, but no one explained the difference.

Britain continued its support for Jewish immigration. In 1917, British General Allenby entered Jerusalem with a Jewish military corps, including David Ben Gurion. By 1918, Jews numbered about 50,000 while Palestinians were around 500,000, with 85% of Palestinians rejecting the idea of a Jewish state. A US committee reported that achieving Balfour's declaration would require a military force of 50,000 soldiers. Despite these challenges, Britain persisted. After World War I ended with Britain's victory over the Ottoman Empire, the League of Nations granted Britain the mandate over Palestine in 1920. Britain appointed Herbert Samuel as the first High Commissioner, facilitating Jewish immigration from 1919 to 1921, with 185,000 Jews arriving and the Jewish National Fund buying 240,000 acres in the Jezreel Valley.

With settlement turning into a European project, violent demonstrations spread across Palestine, starting from Jaffa, resulting in deaths of 95 Jews and 64 Arabs. In June 1922, Churchill's White Paper attempted to calm Arabs, promising that Jews wouldn't occupy Palestine but would create a society that fits the nature, economy, and population of the country. However, Jews created closed communities, replacing Palestinians instead of blending with them. Some Jewish towns, like Tel Aviv, gained local autonomy with separate ministries and educational institutions. By 1929, immigrant numbers doubled, and a Jewish prayer in Jerusalem calling for the revival of the temple and claiming rights to the Wailing Wall (Buraq Wall in Islam) aligned with the Muslim Mawlid, leading to the Buraq Uprising.

The British violently suppressed the uprising, arresting hundreds and executing leaders, treating Palestinians as primitive tribes while supporting civilized white European immigrants. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe notes that Palestinians were described in letters between Balfour, Churchill, and Herbert Samuel using terms like Arabs (meaning nomadic or primitive) and Mohammedans (followers of Mohammed), reflecting a colonial viewpoint that saw Palestinians as part of primitive groups. Churchill bluntly compared Palestinians to dogs in a manger, not owning the barn despite being there for a while, with the right to rule given to civilized Europeans, whether British or Jewish.

Jewish immigration continued, reaching 27% of the population by 1935, with revolts against British colonization led by figures like Izz al-Din al-Qassam, who was killed in battle. His funeral sparked the Great Arab Revolt from April to October 1936, surprising the British with Palestinian resistance. The British responded by killing 1,000 Palestinians, arresting many, and demolishing homes, especially in Jaffa. Britain facilitated Jewish immigration, creating tight-knit Jewish communities and fighting Palestinian revolts, leading to severe oppression by 1940, with 10% of Palestinian men killed, exiled, or arrested.

Britain taught Jews the colonial mindset and developed their military force. The Peel Commission in 1937 suggested dividing the land between Arabs and Jews, with Palestinians as a majority in even Jewish areas. Churchill compared Palestinians to dogs in a manger, suggesting expulsion. Zionist leaders, like Ben Gurion, considered expelling Palestinians from all of Palestine. The Jewish Agency's Josef Weitz stated, "There will be no land for two peoples." Jewish settlers adopted British tactics, including terrorism, sending car bombs to markets in Haifa and Jerusalem under British supervision. Britain increased soldiers in Palestine, describing conditions as concentration camps.

Despite British support, the Zionists sought independence, forming organized military structures like Haganah, Stern, and Irgun. The Zionist movement realized Britain wouldn't remain a great empire post-World War II and sought a new ally, the United States. The Baltimore Conference in 1942 aimed to gather Zionist support in America. The US, with its immigrant background, related to the Zionist dream. Hillary Clinton, in her diary "Hard Choices," mentioned America's immigrant story as similar to Israel's, creating a win-win situation. The US provided funds, and Haganah developed armament factories.

Britain felt betrayed, realizing their one-sided agreement with Zionists, leading to a toxic relationship. Jewish gangs turned against Britain, with Irgun blowing up the King David Hotel in 1946, killing 91 British personnel, and targeting the Officers Club in 1947. The Stern gang even attempted to ally with Nazis. Britain's moral burden of preventing a Palestinian state persisted until 1947 when they handed over the issue to the US. Historian Eugene Rogan noted that Britain, a nation claiming to combat terrorism, was ousted by Zionist terrorism, highlighting the paradox of their relationship.


## **FIFTH MYTH: 'DAVID AND GOLIATH'**

The United Nations issued the Partition Resolution 181, dividing Palestine into six regions: three Arab regions and three Jewish ones, with Jerusalem under international supervision. Despite Palestinians being twice the number of Jews, the resolution allocated 56% of the land to the Jewish state. In 1947, there were 1,200,000 Palestinians and only 600,000 Jews. Palestinians legally owned 94% of the land and 80% of the agricultural land. Despite this, 56% of the land was given to the minority, who only owned 6% of it. This division gave Zionists larger areas but not ethnically unified cities, assigning them cities like Jaffa and Haifa, which were mostly Arab.

Historian Ilan Pappe remarked that no one could have imagined a national liberation movement in Palestine sharing the land with its settlers. The primary goal of Zionism was for Jews not to live with others. The Zionist dream expanded from part of Palestine to all of it. When asked about Israel’s borders, David Ben Gurion said the best definition was the farthest place Israeli soldiers could go. Since its inception, Zionism aimed to keep expanding its territory.

By the end of 1947, the Jewish Agency controlled all of Palestine, with the Haganah organized with 35,000 soldiers, the Palmach commands with over 10,000, and the Irgun and Stern being large, experienced military groups. The Arab front, however, was disorganized, with exhausted armies and conflicting interests. The Arab countries opened volunteering to save Palestine, forming the Arab Liberation Army of 4,000 volunteers. Despite their loyalty, it was an unorganized army, and Palestinian leaders like Abdul Qader Al-Husseini, Fawzi Al-Qawji, and Hassan Salama carried out separate operations with limited effect.

In contrast, the Zionists were planning more dangerous actions. By the end of 1947, they were holding intensive Haganah meetings and shifting from gathering village information to executing Plan Dalet—a complete ethnic cleansing plan. On February 15, 1948, Palmach fighter Yitzhak Rabin led an attack on the village of Caesarea, expelling 1,500 inhabitants. Zionists attacked five villages to test their fighters and ensure British soldiers wouldn’t intervene. They launched organized attacks on villages near Jerusalem, disregarding the designated partition areas.

David Ben Gurion believed Israel’s borders were determined by their soldiers' reach, adhering to an expansionist ideology. The strategy involved besieging villages from three sides, forcing villagers to flee and become refugees elsewhere. Sometimes, they left no escape, like in Deir Yassin on April 9, 1948, where 250 people were killed in a village of 700. Despite a British police office being just 3 km away, no one intervened.

This terror campaign forced 75,000 Palestinians to flee their homes in Jaffa, Haifa, and Jerusalem. Ethnic cleansing involved not only expulsion and eradication but also erasing memories of these places. One kilometer from Deir Yassin, the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum was built, illustrating the paradox of commemorating one genocide while erasing another.

The British mandate handed over infrastructure to Jews, including 2,700 government buildings, 50 train stations, 3,000 km of roads, and 37 camps filled with weapons and spare parts, essentially building the foundation of a new state. According to the Zionist narrative, Palestinian refugees were caused by Arab armies urging citizens to move. However, historian Ilan Pappe states that half the refugees were expelled before the war, and historian Avi Shlaim confirms that the refugee crisis began in the first half of 1948, not due to the war itself.

On May 14, 1948, Israel declared its establishment, presenting itself as David against the giant Goliath. All major powers quickly recognized it, with US President Harry Truman recognizing Israel just 11 minutes after its declaration. The next day, May 15, 1948, Arab armies declared war. The New York Times headline read, "Jews in Grave Danger in All Muslim Lands," hinting at a Holocaust narrative.

However, the combined seven Arab armies numbered around 25,000 soldiers, small and disorganized. Meanwhile, the Jewish army started with 35,000 soldiers, growing to 100,000 by the war's end. These were not mere gangs but trained forces with British experience and World War II operations, well-funded and equipped.

Arab armies underestimated these forces, seeing them as gangs, leading to a shocking defeat. Zionist forces conducted massacres like the bombing of Lod and Ramla and the Tantura massacre. Ilan Pappe notes that massacres occurred not out of necessity but because they could, with Zionists no longer seeing Palestinians as humans.

In August 1948, after the Arab armies' defeat and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees, UN ambassador Count Bernadotte visited Palestine and refugee camps in Jordan. Horrified, he stated it would be an insult to justice to deprive these victims of returning home. However, Bernadotte was assassinated by the Stern gang, with Yitzhak Shamir, a future Israeli Prime Minister, involved.

By December 1948, Jews occupied 85% of Jerusalem outside the old city, in front of the UN. Historian Hillel Cohen noted that thousands of refugees from Sepphoris and surrounding villages sheltered in Nazareth. Ben-Gurion avoided destroying Nazareth due to its Christian significance. Jewish gangs tried to attract Christian Palestinians to return without Muslims, but they refused, showing solidarity.

On December 11, 1948, the UN issued Resolution 194, guaranteeing the right of return for every refugee expelled. However, this right was never implemented. In 1950, Israel announced the right of return for any Jew, even if they had never lived on the land, based on having a Jewish mother. Meanwhile, Palestinian refugees could not return to their ancestral lands.

By the July 1949 Peace Treaty, Zionist forces controlled 78% of the land, not just the 55% allocated by the Partition Resolution. The UN recognized these new borders, calling them the "Green Line." Historian Theodore Katz highlighted that the IDF's morality is based on the fallacy of coming to a land without people, despite 1.3 million Palestinians living there.

New generations in Israel inherit this fictional legend, relying on psychological defense mechanisms like denial and justification to ignore the evidence of killing, genocide, and ethnic cleansing buried just a meter below the land. What happened in Tantura happened throughout Palestinian land.

## **LAST MYTH: 'THE ONLY DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST'**

In 1948, Ben Gurion, an immigrant who spent his youth in Poland, declared that not only had he achieved the Zionist dream, but he was also its founder, earning the title of the state's main founder. This dream envisioned a 100% Jewish country without Arabs, a pure society solely for Jews. Any Palestinian who disturbed this dream faced the fate of places like Jerusalem and Haifa—villages destroyed, ports bombed, streets filled with Palestinian corpses. Those who were lucky were expelled and lived as refugees. The Zionist slogan, "a land without a people for a people without a land," did not tolerate any presence of the other. It was either "us or them." This slogan was adhered to even when Arabs made up 70% of the population and occupied 90% of the land.

Seventy-five years after Ben Gurion declared the achievement of this dream, the Jewish community still maintains its purity, no matter the consequence or price. Israeli Jews enjoy privileges, while Palestinians suffer from discrimination on all levels. This society is summed up by its current leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, who said, “Israel is not a state of all its citizens… [but rather] the nation-state of the Jewish people and only them.” If you are an Arab living on the historical land of Palestine, your life is determined from the beginning by where you live. We can divide this into three categories: 1948 Palestinians, West Bank Palestinians, and Palestinians of Gaza.

The 1948 Palestinians, around 2 million people with Israeli citizenship, constitute 20% of the country but are second-class citizens. They receive fewer years of education because Arabic, spoken by 2 million people, is not officially recognized. Regardless of rank at work, their monthly income is less than that of their Israeli counterparts. If a 1948 Palestinian decides to focus solely on their life and family, they are not allowed to request citizenship for family members outside Israel. Even if they renounce their origin and convert to Judaism, Israeli law makes this nearly impossible.

Life is even harder for the 2.7 million Palestinians living in the West Bank, under direct Israeli occupation. They live in a prison-like structure with sectors of locked gates, requiring passage through numerous military checkpoints, turning a 5-minute walk into an hours-long inspection. Surrounded by over 130 illegal settlements housing 500,000 settlers, their situation is dire. Between 2017 and 2021, the Israeli army issued only 33 building permits to Palestinians while demolishing over 1,150 homes and granting 1,100 permits to illegal settlers. A Palestinian whose home is demolished cannot even put up a tent without a permit, which they rarely receive. Water, a basic human right, is distributed discriminatorily—settlers receive 300 liters per day, while Palestinians get only 80 liters every 15 days, far below the WHO standard of 100 liters.

In Gaza, 2 million people live in a 360 square km area under complete siege, without ports, airports, or trains. Nothing enters or leaves without Israeli army permission. Some sources claim the Israeli army controls the amount of calories entering Gaza, calculating food supplies based on population needs. Most land is unsuitable for farming, groundwater is polluted, and 90% of it is unfit for consumption or agriculture. Eighty percent of the population relies on international aid, and constant electricity is a luxury. Gaza's need for 560 megawatts is met with only 200 megawatts, resulting in a 50% unemployment rate. Despite not being militarily occupied, Gaza is an open-air prison controlled by Israel.

The International Committee of the Red Cross considers this a complete violation of the Geneva Conventions. Israeli academic Oren Yiftachel describes Israel as an ethnocracy, a country serving Jews only and harming the Arab minority to maintain its purity. Israel is an apartheid state, as confirmed by figures like Noam Chomsky, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and even the Israeli Minister of Education.

Apartheid is the expected outcome of the original Zionist idea, where identity determines rights, and Palestinians are robbed of theirs. We hope for a world where Palestinians can attain their rights as humans and as a people. Understanding the roots of this reality helps us envision a better future, embodying what makes us human.
