[Opening scene: Panoramic view of the Mediterranean Sea, transitioning to a seagull flying towards the coastline.]

**Narrator**: "Welcome to another episode. Today, let's take a journey through time and space, starting with our imagination as a seagull soaring over the Mediterranean Sea. As we fly east, we reach a charming coastal area between Tel Aviv and Haifa, known today as Dor."

[Scene shifts to picturesque views of Dor, showcasing its beaches, coral reefs, and lush greenery.]

**Narrator**: "Dor is an idyllic resort, with soft sands, a pleasant atmosphere, and vibrant coral reefs. It boasts greenery, a museum, and archaeological sites dating back to the Bronze Age. Modern houses reminiscent of Florida, surrounded by numerous resorts, add to its charm."

[Scene transitions to an aerial view of Nahsholim Resort and the old Arab-style building nearby.]

**Narrator**: "Amidst this modern beauty stands Nahsholim Resort, and just a few meters away, a small, old Arab-style building. In 1991, a resident planned to build a diving center next to this house, but the project abruptly stopped when workers discovered human bones buried at a shallow depth."

[Cut to a reenactment of the discovery and the worker's reaction.]

**Narrator**: "The site was sealed off and abandoned. Fouad Hasadiyeh, a fisherman from the nearby Arab village of Al-Faradis, inquired about the abandonment. He was told the bones dated back to Napoleon's era, but Fouad insisted they were the remains of Palestinians killed in 1948, buried in mass graves, one of which lay beneath the parking lot of Nahsholim Resort."

[Scene shifts to historical photos and maps of Tantura, with a narration over.]

**Narrator**: "Before becoming a resort, this place was the Palestinian fishing village of Tantura, located south of Haifa. It was home to about 1,500 Palestinians, who lived peacefully, relying on fishing and farming. However, during the Nakba in 1948, the village was brutally taken over."

[Scene transitions to footage and photos from the Nakba period.]

**Narrator**: "For 50 years, Tantura was only mentioned in Israel as a site of a 'battle' during the war of 'Independence.' This narrative was challenged in 1998 by Teddy Katz, an Israeli student at the University of Haifa. His master's thesis revealed that the 'battle' was a massacre."

[Cut to interviews and clips from the documentary “Tantura” by Alon Schwarz.]

**Narrator**: "Katz's research and interviews with old soldiers from the Alexandroni Brigade exposed the horrific events of May 22, 1948. The poorly armed villagers surrendered, leading to a massacre. Soldiers separated men and women, stripped women of valuables, expelled them, and executed the men and boys."

[Scene shifts to testimonies from soldiers and survivors.]

**Narrator**: "Testimonies from soldiers, featured in the documentary 'Tantura,' were chilling. Soldiers described the killings with disturbing nonchalance, revealing a harrowing truth about the massacre. Survivors and their descendants, now in places like Al-Faradis, live with the memories and the uncertainty of where their relatives are buried."

[Scene shows Forensic Architecture's investigation and 3D modeling.]

**Narrator**: "In May 2023, Forensic Architecture published an investigation identifying mass grave locations using historical imagery and 3D modeling. They confirmed graves under modern-day facilities like the Nahsholim Resort."

[Cut to footage of protests, Nakba commemorations, and interviews with anti-Zionist voices.]

**Narrator**: "The Israeli narrative about the Nakba and events like Tantura has been systematically suppressed. Teddy Katz faced a defamation lawsuit, destroying his academic career. Eyal Weizman, founder of Forensic Architecture, had his books banned in Israel. The 2011 Nakba Law further silenced discussion, threatening financial penalties for institutions acknowledging the Nakba."

[Scene transitions to historical footage of Britain’s involvement and Zionist movements.]

**Narrator**: "Israel's founding myths paint a heroic narrative, often masking the darker realities. The British played a significant role in facilitating Zionist goals. The Balfour Declaration and subsequent British actions paved the way for Jewish immigration and settlement, despite Palestinian resistance."

[Scene shows maps and graphics illustrating the displacement and current living conditions of Palestinians.]

**Narrator**: "By 1948, Zionist forces executed a well-planned campaign of ethnic cleansing, resulting in the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians. Today, Palestinians face systemic discrimination and oppression within Israel and the occupied territories, living under conditions described as apartheid by many human rights organizations."

[Closing scene: Panoramic view of Palestine and Israel today, with a hopeful tone.]

**Narrator**: "Understanding the roots and evolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is crucial for imagining a just and peaceful future. By uncovering and acknowledging the suppressed truths of the past, we can hope to pave the way for genuine reconciliation and coexistence. Thank you for joining us on this journey through history."
