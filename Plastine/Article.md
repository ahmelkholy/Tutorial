# The Untold Story of Tantura: A Dive into History

Imagine yourself as a seagull flying over the Mediterranean Sea, heading east until you reach a coastal point between Tel Aviv and Haifa. There, you will discover a charming and beautiful place known today as Dor. It's an ideal resort that rivals the beaches of Greece, Cyprus, and Sicily, boasting soft sand, a pleasant atmosphere, coral reefs, lush greenery, a museum, and archaeological sites dating back to the Bronze Age. The area is dotted with houses that resemble those in Florida, complemented by numerous resorts offering various services and facilities.

From your vantage point as a seagull, you'll notice a modern resort named Nahsholim. A few meters away from it stands a small building in an old Arab style, conspicuously different from its surroundings. In 1991, a resident decided to build a diving center next to this house. However, the project was abruptly halted when workers unearthed human bones buried at a shallow depth. The site was sealed off, and the workers never returned.

A local fisherman named Fouad Hasadiyeh from the Arab village of Al-Faradis observed this and inquired about the abandonment. He was told the bones were from Napoleon's era, but Fouad insisted they were the remains of Palestinians killed in 1948 and buried in mass graves, one of which lay beneath the parking lot of the Nahsholim Resort. This revelation points to a darker history when this place was known as the Palestinian fishing village of Tantura.

## The Forgotten Village of Tantura

Tantura, located south of Haifa, was home to about 1,500 Palestinians who lived peacefully, relying on fishing and farming. However, in 1948, during the Nakba, the village experienced a tragic fate. For decades, Tantura was only mentioned in Israel as a site of a "battle" during the war of "Independence," where Israelis claimed victory and Arabs "emigrated" to nearby villages like Al-Faradis. It wasn't until 1998 that the truth began to emerge when Teddy Katz, an Israeli student at the University of Haifa, published his master's thesis revealing a massacre.

Katz's research, based on interviews with old soldiers from the Alexandroni Brigade who invaded Tantura on May 22, 1948, exposed that the "battle" was, in reality, a one-sided slaughter. The poorly armed villagers surrendered, leading to a massacre rather than a fair fight. Soldiers separated men and women, stripping women of valuables and expelling them, while executing the men and boys near the Arab House.

## Witnesses and Whispers of the Past

The testimonies Katz gathered were harrowing and later featured in the documentary "Tantura" by Israeli director Alon Schwarz. Soldiers recounted graphic details of the killings, expressing a chilling nonchalance about the number of people they murdered. These were not the testimonies of the victims but of the perpetrators, revealing the depth of the atrocity.

Survivors of the massacre and their descendants, now living in places like Al-Faradis, remain haunted by the memories and the uncertainty of where their relatives are buried. In May 2023, Forensic Architecture, a research agency, published an investigation identifying mass grave locations using historical and contemporary imagery and 3D modeling, confirming the presence of graves under modern-day facilities like the Nahsholim Resort.

## Silencing the Truth

The Israeli narrative about the Nakba and events like those in Tantura has been systematically suppressed. Teddy Katz faced a defamation lawsuit by war criminals, forcing him to retract his statements and ending his academic career. Eyal Weizman, founder of Forensic Architecture, had his books banned in Israel. The 2011 Nakba Law further stifled discussion, threatening financial penalties for institutions that acknowledge the Nakba.

Prominent anti-Zionist voices, such as Ilan Papp√©, author of "10 Myths About Israel," faced expulsion and censorship. These measures ensure the dominance of a fabricated national narrative that paints Israel as a heroic underdog rather than a perpetrator of ethnic cleansing.

## The Fabricated Narrative

Israel's founding myths, taught in schools, weave a story of Jewish perseverance and modern technological triumph over a barren land, reminiscent of American frontier tales. This narrative elicits sympathy and admiration while depicting Palestinians as either invisible or malevolent aggressors.

Historical facts, however, reveal a different picture. Jewish communities thrived peacefully in Arab countries under Ottoman rule, contrasting the harsh realities faced by Jews in Europe. Zionism, born from European anti-Semitism, sought a Jewish state not out of religious fervor but as a colonial project.

## Britain and the Birth of Israel

Contrary to the myth of Britain as an obstacle, historical records show Britain's significant role in facilitating Zionist goals. The Balfour Declaration of 1917 and subsequent British actions paved the way for Jewish immigration and settlement, despite Palestinian resistance and suffering. The Jewish militias, trained and armed, eventually turned against their British benefactors, employing terrorism to achieve their aims.

## The Nakba and Its Aftermath

By 1948, Zionist forces executed a well-planned campaign of ethnic cleansing, resulting in the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians. The establishment of Israel on May 14, 1948, was quickly recognized by global powers, framing the narrative of a brave David against a monstrous Goliath. However, the reality was an overwhelming Zionist military force facing poorly organized Arab armies and militias.

## The Ongoing Struggle

Today, Palestinians face systemic discrimination and oppression within Israel and the occupied territories. The Israeli state maintains a veneer of democracy while implementing policies of apartheid, as highlighted by organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The enduring struggle for Palestinian rights and recognition continues against a backdrop of historical denial and international complicity.

Understanding the roots and evolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is crucial for imagining a just and peaceful future. By uncovering and acknowledging the suppressed truths of the past, we can hope to pave the way for genuine reconciliation and coexistence.
