1. **Introduction to AI Chatbots**
   - Explain what AI chatbots are and their importance in today's digital world.
   - Discuss the different types of chatbots (e.g., customer service, personal assistants, etc.).

what is chatgpt 

many scripts are open source at github one of them is the transforms which is used to convert the text to the chatbot to be more human like.

so infact it is not a new technologies but what is the new is the data and the models that are used to train the chatbot.

so what the open ai sell is the model and the data not the software itself or the script itself. the power to get more data and train the model is the key to get the best chatbot. and i think it is the reason for openai to go to an agreement with microsoft to get more data and train the model, besides the cost of the hardware to train the model.

to responce for this step anothers tech company tack the same way to prevent the monopoly of the chatbot market by the openai or microsoft in behaind the scene, for instance the facebook and the google.

facebook which is a company based on the data collected from the users and the ads, so it is a good idea to use the data to train the chatbot and the model, and the same for the google.

facebook group it up be announcing open source not the script but the model itself which is called llm

the base technologies for all chatpots is the neural network, which is not new it is an mathemtical model used to simulate the human brain, in how to learn the relation ship between the input and outpot, the hardware is the bottel nick which prevent the wide use of the neural network, but the new hardware and the new data make it possible to use the neural network in the chatbot.

some roomers are saying that the model of the chatgpt 3.5 is not larger than 100 GB and the cost of the hardware to train the model is not more than 10,000$, however the 100 gb it is not the storage needed its the operating memory needed to run the model and git the answer from them in the real time, infact this model can run in many gamming computer with the cost of 2000, however running it in a server for puplic users costs more mony for the electricity and the hardware.

lets introduce you one of the very simple nn used in the power system as an explantion for the idea it is a matlab program to identifies the fault in a transfromer based on data input and classifcation technique, the data is a diagnosied data for the a power transformers and to train this data is so simple that we can use the matlap on it as seen in proccess

ofcourse the chatbot is more complex than this simple nn, but the idea is the same, the data and the model is the key to get the best chatbot.

the language used to trains the model is the python, and the library used is the pytorch, and the hardware used is the nvidia gpu, and the data is the key to get the best chatbot.

so in this case i want to introduce to how to make you own offline chatbot using the open source models in the lm studio and the open source models in the hugging face format.

those model is not power as chatgpt itself but till now i want to say the chatgpt is a probitory model with a free accesse to it, however the model it self is a closed source.

that mean not only the personals can not access the powerfull of the ai but also the governments in the third world keeping the power of ai in the hand of first world countries.

russia and china create then owns throw the owned tech companies to prevent the monopoly of the ai in the hand of the first world countries. but those countries already has the data gathed over the years from thier own people and the other countries. throw companies like yandex and baidu.

where is the third world


so if you need to run up your own chatbot you need to follow the following steps

1. setup the llm studio
2. choice the model suitable for your machine 
3. create a servire on your machine to make other software to access the model if it needed 

with this simple step you can run your own chatbot without the need to the internet or the cloud, infact you can autmate your computer or small business with the chatbot, but this chatpot not very powerfull as chatgpt or gemnini or bard, but it is yours and belong to open source community.
