**Narrator:**
"Traditional firewalls operate at the network level, scanning packets and using predefined rules to block malicious traffic. However, they lack the ability to understand the application logic, user workflows, and data structures unique to custom web apps and APIs. This makes them vulnerable to sophisticated attacks like SQL injections, broken authentication, and cross-site scripting."
