**Narrator**: 

As AI takes center stage in Silicon Valley, an inconvenient truth is emerging behind the scenes: AI has a massive carbon footprint.

---

[Cut to a clip of bustling tech offices and data centers]

**Narrator**:

Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have made bold commitments to slash greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years, but the technology they’re betting their futures on is making those climate goals increasingly challenging to achieve.

---

[Visual: Microsoft logo]

**Narrator**:

Microsoft revealed that its carbon emissions had surged nearly 30% since 2020, mainly due to the construction and operation of energy-hungry data centers needed to power its AI ambitions.

---

[Visual: Google logo]

**Narrator**:

Google reported an even steeper 48% rise in emissions compared to 2019. These trends highlight the growing tension between rapid AI development and environmental sustainability in the tech sector.

---

[Cut to a high-tech server room with rows of servers]

**Narrator**:

The root of the problem lies in AI’s immense appetite for computing power and electricity. Training large language models like GPT-3 requires vast amounts of data to be processed by thousands of specialized chips running around the clock in sprawling data centers.

[Interview Clip: Jesse Dodge, Researcher at the Allen Institute for AI]

**Jesse Dodge**:

“One query to ChatGPT uses approximately as much electricity as could light one light bulb for about 20 minutes. So, you can imagine that millions of people using something like that every day adds up to a really large amount of electricity.”

---

[Visual: Goldman Sachs logo]

**Narrator**:

According to Goldman Sachs analysts, a typical ChatGPT query requires nearly ten times as much electricity as a standard Google search. As AI capabilities expand and usage skyrockets, so too does its energy demand.

---

[Visual: Global electricity consumption chart]

**Narrator**:

Goldman Sachs estimates that data centers will consume 8% of global electricity by 2030, up from about 3% today—a massive jump primarily driven by AI.

---

[Cut to a busy city with heavy power consumption, then to coal plants]

**Narrator**:

The tech industry’s intense electricity consumption impacts regional power grids and even influences decisions around fossil fuel use. Data center operators in Northern Virginia are expected to require enough electricity to power 6 million homes by 2030.

---

[Visual: Microsoft sustainability report]

**Narrator**:

This puts tech giants in a difficult position as they try to balance their AI ambitions with climate commitments. Microsoft has pledged to become carbon-negative by 2030, removing more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits.

---

[Visual: Google campus with sustainability efforts]

**Narrator**:

Google had long touted its carbon-neutral status, achieved through carbon offsets. But in 2023, it admitted it was no longer “maintaining operational carbon neutrality” due to emissions growth. The company still aims for net-zero emissions by 2030 but called that timeline “fraught with challenges.”

---

[Visual: OpenAI logo]

**Narrator**:

Other major players in AI development, like OpenAI, have yet to disclose any emissions data, leaving the full scope of the industry’s climate impact unclear.

[Interview Clip: Alex Hanna, Director of Research at the Distributed AI Research Institute]

**Alex Hanna**:

“We have an existential crisis right now. It’s called climate change, and AI is palpably making it worse.”

---

[Visual: Tech companies investing in renewable energy]

**Narrator**:

To their credit, tech companies are not ignoring the problem. They’re investing heavily in renewable energy, exploring more efficient chip designs, and researching ways to reduce AI’s energy needs.

---

[Visual: Microsoft and Google sustainability efforts]

**Narrator**:

However, these efforts are being outpaced by the breakneck speed of AI development and deployment. Every major tech firm is racing to integrate AI across their product lines, from search engines to productivity software to social media.

---

[Visual: Busy tech offices with AI integration]

**Narrator**:

This leaves the tech industry at a crossroads. Companies must find ways to dramatically improve AI’s energy efficiency or risk undermining their climate goals and facing growing criticism over their environmental impact.

[Interview Clip: Brad Smith, President of Microsoft]

**Brad Smith**:

“The answer is not to slow down the expansion of AI but to speed up the work needed to make it more environmentally friendly.”

---

[Closing shot: Earth with AI technology overlay]

**Narrator**:

The coming years will be crucial in determining whether artificial intelligence becomes a powerful tool for addressing climate change or accelerates the very problem it could help solve.

**Narrator**:

For now, the tech industry believes in its ability to innovate its way out of this dilemma. Time will tell if that optimism is warranted or if more drastic measures will be needed to reconcile AI’s promise with its environmental price tag.
