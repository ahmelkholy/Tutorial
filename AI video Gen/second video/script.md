**Host:** "In a groundbreaking report published on Monday, it was revealed that Apple has made a significant strategic shift in its AI hardware strategy, choosing to sidestep industry leader Nvidia in favor of chips designed by Google."

[Cut to: Close-up of the report headline on the screen.]

**Host:** "Instead of utilizing Nvidia’s renowned GPUs for its artificial intelligence software infrastructure, Apple will now use Google chips as the cornerstone for its upcoming AI-related features and tools."

[Cut to: Animation showing Nvidia, Google, and other cloud computing companies in a market share pie chart.]

**Host:** "This decision is particularly intriguing because Nvidia has already captured a substantial portion of this market, with Google, Amazon, and other cloud computing companies accounting for 80% of the overall share. By opting for Google’s chips, Apple seems to be making a savvy move to diversify its hardware dependencies."

[Cut to: Image of Apple’s research paper with highlighted sections.]

**Host:** "While Apple hasn't explicitly stated that it is avoiding Nvidia chips, a research paper detailing the company's AI infrastructure noticeably omits any mention of Nvidia. When questioned, Apple declined to comment, leaving industry analysts to speculate."

[Cut to: Infographic showing Google's TPUv5p and TPUv4 chips with corresponding numbers.]

**Host:** "According to the paper, Apple's AI model training process leverages two distinct types of Google’s tensor processing units, or TPUs, organized in expansive clusters. Google deployed 2,048 of its advanced TPUv5p chips and 8,192 TPUv4 processors to support this initiative."

[Cut to: Comparison between TPUs and GPUs, highlighting differences in design and access.]

**Host:** "Google’s TPUs differ significantly from Nvidia’s GPUs, which are almost synonymous with machine learning development. Unlike Nvidia’s independent availability, Google’s TPUs are only accessible through the Google Cloud Platform, compelling customers to use Google’s cloud services."

[Cut to: Footage of beta testers using new Apple AI features.]

**Host:** "This revelation comes as Apple begins rolling out its Apple Intelligence capabilities to beta users. The developer beta program now includes various AI-powered features, such as enhanced Writing Tools, an improved Siri that understands both text and voice, and AI-powered Mail and Smart Replies."

[Cut to: Users providing feedback on Apple AI features.]

**Host:** "Beta testers can now transcribe dictations with AI assistance and provide valuable feedback, enabling Apple to refine its AI features, including expanding Siri's functionality to interact with third-party apps. This iterative approach aims for a polished general release in the fall."

[Cut to: Stock footage of Apple’s annual developer conference.]

**Host:** "Interestingly, Reuters reported in June about Apple’s use of TPU chips, but the full extent of this collaboration with Google remained under wraps until this detailed research emerged. Apple’s engineers suggest that more advanced and complex models could be developed with Google’s chips, indicating the beginning of a deeper AI integration."

[Cut to: Footage from Apple’s annual developer conference.]

**Host:** "Just last week, at Apple’s annual developer conference, the company showcased new AI capabilities, including the integration of OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology into its software ecosystem. The tech community was abuzz, seeing it as a testament to Apple’s forward-thinking approach."

[Cut to: Stock ticker showing Apple's stock price.]

**Host:** "Despite the significance of this news, Apple’s stock showed only a slight reaction, dipping 0.1% to $218.24 on Monday. This muted response suggests investors are adopting a cautious stance on Apple’s AI strategy, mindful of the company’s methodical entry into new technological arenas."

[Closing Scene: Host standing in the newsroom, smiling at the camera.]

**Host:** "That’s all for today’s update on Apple’s strategic pivot in AI hardware. Stay tuned for more tech news and insights. Thanks for watching!"
