# What is a Research Paper?

A research paper is a comprehensive piece of academic writing that is based on the author's original research on a particular topic, along with the analysis and interpretation of the research findings. It can be a term paper, a masterâ€™s thesis, or a doctoral dissertation. This form of writing usually follows a standard composition format, which encourages the development of logical thought processes. It boosts the ability of the writer to think critically, organize their thoughts, and express themselves accurately.

## Why Do We Need Research Papers?

Research papers serve a multitude of purposes. They are a staple in the academic world and are used as a tool to share and gain knowledge. Here are a few reasons why research papers are important:

1. **Learning Opportunity**: Writing a research paper is an excellent way to learn about a specific topic in depth. It provides a chance to explore different books, articles, and other resources to gather information and make connections.

2. **Critical Thinking**: The process of writing a research paper involves critical thinking - questioning your sources, making an argument, and backing it up with evidence. This helps in developing analytical and critical thinking skills.

3. **Academic Credibility**: Research papers contribute to the body of scientific literature and validate your grasp over the subject. They can also be a requirement for academic degrees.

4. **Communication Skills**: Writing a research paper helps in improving writing skills and teaches the writer to convey thoughts clearly and concisely.

## To Whom is This Being Written?

Research papers are typically written for the academic community. They are usually aimed at scholars in the same field who are familiar with the subject matter but can also be understood by non-specialist readers. The language, style, and content should be appropriate for the intended audience. The writer should assume that readers have a basic understanding of the topic but should not assume they are experts, hence the need for a thorough explanation and analysis of all facts. The goal is to contribute to the ongoing conversation on the topic among scholars and researchers.

## what is research?

Research is a systematic inquiry that investigates hypotheses, suggests new interpretations of data or texts, and poses new questions for future research to explore. It is a methodical process of inquiry that aims to solve problems, answer questions, or contribute to existing knowledge. Research can take many forms, including scientific experiments, surveys, interviews, and textual analysis. The goal of research is to produce new knowledge or deepen our understanding of a particular topic.

## the scientific method

1. **Observation**: The first step in the scientific method is to observe a phenomenon or ask a question about the natural world.
2. **Hypothesis**: After observing a phenomenon, a researcher will propose a hypothesis, which is a testable explanation for the observed phenomenon. 
3. **devoloping an experiment**: The next step is to design an experiment to test the hypothesis. The experiment should be carefully controlled to ensure that the results are valid and reliable.
4. **Data Collection**: The researcher will then collect data by conducting the experiment and recording the results.
5. **Analysis**: The data collected will be analyzed to determine if the results support the hypothesis.
6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the data, the researcher will draw a conclusion about whether the hypothesis is supported or not.
7. **Sharing the results**: Finally, the researcher will share the results of the experiment with the scientific community through a research paper or presentation.

## Observation

i will take about the Observation in the engineering field, in the applied mathematics field the observation could be a apsence of a solution for a specific problem, abscence of a specific theorem, or abscence of a model, or data for anaylsis or any other chalanage that could be solved by research.

## Hypothesis

in the engineering, the hypotheses a one solution for the problem that we have observed, this
