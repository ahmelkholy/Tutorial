## Why Choose Zotero Over EndNote and Mendeley?

- EndNote is a great tool, but it's not free. Some users resort to using cracked versions, which is not only illegal but also risky.
- Mendeley was a great option, but after being acquired by Elsevier, they shifted to a web-only version, forcing users to abandon their desktop applications.
