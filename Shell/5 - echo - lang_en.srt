00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
The dollar symbol in front of a word indicates that it is a shell variable.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:14,009
The command echo $COLUMNS X $LINES prints out the size of your terminal.

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,620
Now 80 x 24 is a really common size.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,190
Mine's a little bit wider than that because this is a wide screen video.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,120
But if you resize the terminal,

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,970
these variables will change.

7
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,199
We'll see a lot more about shell variables later in this course.
