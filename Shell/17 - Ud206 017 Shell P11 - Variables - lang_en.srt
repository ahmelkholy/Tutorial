1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,189
The shell is actually a little programming language.

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,570
Just like JavaScript or Python, it has variables.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,440
They look a little different though.

4
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:12,219
In the shell, whenever you create or modify a variable,

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,214
you just give it a name and an equal sign,

6
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:18,300
followed by the value that you want it to have.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,070
Note that you can't put any spaces around the equal sign.

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,320
Then when you want to refer to the variable,

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,475
you put a dollar sign in front of its name.

10
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:30,660
But they're actually two different kinds of variables in the shell.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,259
One of them is called a shell variable.

12
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:37,619
The lines and columns variables that you saw earlier are these kind.

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,969
These are just internal to the shell program itself.

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:44,274
The other kind is called an environment variable.

15
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:48,859
Environment variables are shared with programs that you run from within the shell.

16
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:53,590
One environment variable that's really important is the path variable.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,570
That tells your system where your program files are.

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,910
So when you type a command,

19
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:01,289
such as LS, it can find the program to run it.

20
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,495
For instance, on my system the LS program is in slash bin slash LS.

21
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:08,594
So it's in the slash bin directory,

22
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:12,120
and the slash bin directory is here in my path variable.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,260
The directories in the path variable are separated by

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,490
colons and the shell searches them starting with the first one,

25
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:23,534
and then proceeding to the right until it finds the command that you entered.

26
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:27,439
That's how the shell is able to find the LS command when I want to run.

27
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,409
You'll sometimes see instructions telling you to add a directory to your path,

28
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,539
so that programs in it can be found.

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,880
To add the new directory to the end of your path,

30
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,185
you do it like this: path equals dollar sign path colon,

31
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:42,299
and then the new directory.

32
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,840
But if you do it like this right at the shell prompt,

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,025
that change will only last until you close the shell.

34
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,745
We'll take a look at where you do it if you want to keep that changed next.

35
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,329
But first a couple of quizzes.
