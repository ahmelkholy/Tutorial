1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,015
The quiz gave you four file names and asked,

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:05,915
what's a single command that will delete the second

3
00:00:05,915 --> 00:00:10,019
two while leaving the first two intact?

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,214
Now the first option, rm quote,

5
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:16,184
bad file quote, space quote,

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:18,329
good name bad face quote.

7
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,344
That'll work just fine.

8
00:00:20,344 --> 00:00:24,634
It'll remove the two files we want to get while not touching the other two.

9
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:26,505
But it's kind of long.

10
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:28,945
That's a lot longer than the other options.

11
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:33,765
And the second one will remove every file whose name contains bad.

12
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:37,829
But that includes bad name good file which we wanted to keep.

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,519
So that option is not great.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,280
The third one rm bad exclamation point good is not something that the shell understands.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,170
It'll give you a weird error if you try it,

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,010
but it won't do anything terrible.

17
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:55,114
And the fourth one, rm star quotes bad space F quote star.

18
00:00:55,115 --> 00:01:01,295
That will remove every file whose name contains bad space F which includes,

19
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,939
bad file and good name bad face.

20
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,359
Exactly what we want.

21
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,200
So the answer is that we can use either the first or the fourth option.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,000
But I'd go with the fourth one because it's the shortest.
