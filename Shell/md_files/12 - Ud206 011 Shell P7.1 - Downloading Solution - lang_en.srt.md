So the command that we're
looking for starts with curl,

and it ends with the tinyurl.com
URL that we were talking about.

But before that, we want
to follow redirects,

and we want to save
it as dictionary.txt.

See that little progress meter.

And there we go.

By the way, you might
notice that I've

been putting single quotes
around all these URLs.

The reason for that
is that a lot of URLs

have special characters in them,
such as the ampersand sign,

and so it's a good idea to
get in the habit of putting

single quotes around them, even
if in these particular cases

it would work fine
just to not do that.
