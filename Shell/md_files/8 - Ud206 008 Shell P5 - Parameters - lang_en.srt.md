You've seen how
many Shell commands

can be given the name of
a file or a directory,

like ls and cd can.

But that's not the only thing
you can tell a Shell command.

Many of them also support
options, or flags,

or parameters that turn on extra
behavior or special features.

Here's an example, ls-l--

the -l is an option to ls.

You can also use it along
with the name of a directory,

like this.

And what it does is to print out
a longer more detailed listing

of files.

The l is for long.

Try it out yourself and see
what you can find in it.

Here's something else you
can try along with it.

The Shell let's you match
filenames with a pattern.

Let's say you want to
list all the PDF documents

in your Documents directory.

The way to do this is
with a star, like this--

ls-l Documents/*.pdf.

The Shell turns the
star into a list

of all of the files whose
names match that pattern.

In this case, that's all of
the files whose file names end

in .pdf.
