So with all
of this CDing around,

it's possible to
get kind of lost.

Depending on your
system, the shell prompt

might or might not tell you
what directory you're in,

but there is a command
that will always tell you,

the pwd command.

That stands for Print
Working Directory.

The working directory is another
word for whatever directory

the shell is
currently looking at.

It's the default directory
for commands like ls.

And it's the default
place that shell commands

will look for data files.

You'll notice that the
names of directories

are separated by slashes.

The Unix system uses the forward
slash, not the backslash,

to separate the
names of directories.

Forward slash is the same one
you've seen in URLs on the web.

This whole string, composed
of several directory

names separated by
slashes, is called a path.

There are a few special
directory names.

You've seen dot,
dot before, it means

the parent directory,
the directory

that this directory is inside.

There's also dot, just
means the current directory.

ls dot is just the same as ls.

And the shell also has a
shortcut, the tilde, which

stands for my home directory.

Like regardless of what
directory your CD'd into,

ls tilde will list
your home directory.
