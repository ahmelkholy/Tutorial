Hey, there.

Let's talk about
the shell The shell

is a command-line interface
for running programs

on your computer.

You type commands at a prompt.

And the shell runs programs for
you and shows you their output.

Developers use it a lot,
because it's fast and flexible.

Also, the vast majority
of web servers in the wild

run on Linux.

And the shell is a vital
tool for deployment

and remote administration
on Linux servers.

Now, compared to using a
graphical environment, or GUI,

when you use the
shell, you do have

to remember a bunch of magic
words and incantations.

But in exchange, once
you get some practice in,

you get to do things
really quickly

without a lot of
pointing and clicking.

It's kind of like
programming, really.

If you've used the JavaScript
console in your browser,

or any other programming
languages interpreter, well,

the idea of the shell's command
line is pretty much the same.

You type out instructions
in a special language,

and the system runs them.

And it shows you the
output underneath.

Then you get another prompt.

And you can do it again.

The JavaScript console is a
command line for your browser.

But the shell is a command line
for your computer in general,

working with files
and directories,

running programs,
and interacting

with other computers.

Now, the program that we use
to interact with the shell

is called a terminal program.

If you're on Mac or
Linux, you've already

got a good one of these.

It's got an icon
that looks like this.

If you're on Windows,
though, we'll

take a look at how to
install a shell and terminal

program that works the same
as the ones on Mac and Linux.

Windows does have a
built-in command shell.

It's based on the old MS-DOS
command line rather than

the UNIX heritage.

For web developers,
a UNIX-style shell

is pretty much a
professional standard,

because so much of the
web runs on Linux servers.

So that's what we'll be
looking at in this course.

Specifically, will be
using the Bash shell,

which is by far the most
popular UNIX-style shell.

The first thing we'll do in
this course is to get you up

and running in the terminal.

Then we'll take a quick
tour of shell commands

for navigating files
and directories.

You'll learn commands for
downloading files from the web,

viewing text files, and
customizing the shell itself

to make it friendlier.

So let's get started.
