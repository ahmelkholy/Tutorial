OK, let's talk about Windows.

If you're using a Mac or
Linux or some other Unix-based

system, you can just skip
this page completely.

Just go on to the next page.

Great.

So everyone who's watching,
you're on Windows, right?

Cool.

So what we want
to do for you now

is to get you a
Unix-style shell.

Well, what do I mean
by "Unix-style"?

Well, I mean it's compatible
with the shells used

on Linux and other
Unix-like systems,

which is what the majority
of web servers run on.

Windows comes from a different
lineage of operating systems

than Linux, so it takes
a little extra effort

to get Windows compatible
with the rest of the world.

But that's OK.

The most popular Unix-style
shell for Windows

is the one that comes with the
Git Version Control software.

It's called Git Bash.

And to install it,
we'll install Git.

So go to git-scm.com
and download Git.

I'm just going to click
through this installer.

Next.

Sure.

These all sound great.

I'll do that.

When I get to this page
about adjusting your path

environment, I'm just going to
accept the default. Default's

good here, too.

And now it's asking me
what terminal emulator

I want to use with Git Bash.

I'm going to choose the default
here as well, which is MinTTY.

Defaults are good there, too.

Just going to wait
for that to install.

This can take a few minutes,
but we're going to speed this up

so you don't have to
watch the whole time.

You'll be seeing enough of
it on your own computer.

OK.

We're done.

And now we have a
program called Git Bash.

Let's run that.

And here we go a--
terminal window.

Hmm.

It's a little bit hard to read.

The font's kind of small.

I'm going to go in
here and change that.

Ah, much better.

Great.

Now that that's set up, let's
take a look at what we've

got going on here.
