The dollar symbol in front of a word indicates that it is a shell variable.

The command echo $COLUMNS X $LINES prints out the size of your terminal.

Now 80 x 24 is a really common size.

Mine's a little bit wider than that because this is a wide screen video.

But if you resize the terminal,

these variables will change.

We'll see a lot more about shell variables later in this course.
