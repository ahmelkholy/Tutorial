So here we are in a terminal.

Inside the terminal window,
we see a little message here,

and another message
here, and a cursor.

Now, this message
is the Shell prompt.

It usually displays some
information about the computer

you're logged into.

Exactly what
message you see here

will depend on your system.

Later on, we'll see
how to change it.

If you type something in at the
Shell prompt and press Enter,

the Shell will try
to run whatever

you typed as a command.

Throughout this course,
you'll be learning

a bunch of Shell commands.

Here's the first one.

The echo command is how we get
the Shell to print messages

back to us.

It's like console.log in
JavaScript or Print in Python.

Try it out.

OK, what happens if I
want the greeting to be

a little bit more enthusiastic?

Hello, shello followed
by two exclamation marks.

Huh, that's weird.

Hello, shello echo.

Hello, shello.

Hello, shello echo.

Hello, shello.

Hey, if I said that a
bunch of times in a row

that could be a number one jam.

Hello, shello echo.

Hello, shello.

Hello, shello echo.

Hello, shello.

The point being, there
are some characters

that have a special
meaning to the Shell.

The exclamation
mark is one of them.

If you're ever typing
something into the Shell

and it seems to be treating what
you're saying in a weird way,

all you usually need to do is
to put single quotes around it.

Huh, there we go.

That's a little bit
less repetitive.
